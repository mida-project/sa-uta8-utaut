Welcome to the GitHub repository for our paper "[Modeling Adoption of Intelligent Agents in Medical Imaging](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhcs.2022.102922)" ([doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhcs.2022.102922](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhcs.2022.102922)) publised in the top tear (Q1 in 2022) [International Journal of Human-Computer Studies (IJHCS)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/international-journal-of-human-computer-studies) of [Elsevier](https://www.elsevier.com/)! This paper investigates the factors affecting the acceptance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in medical imaging using a model based on the [Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_theory_of_acceptance_and_use_of_technology). Our study includes an international evaluation of healthcare practitioners and provides valuable theoretical contributions to researchers by explaining the reasons behind the adoption and usage of intelligent agents in the medical imaging workflow. We hope that our research will inform and inspire future studies in this exciting and rapidly developing field. To organize our user evaluations, we devide each study in a group of User Tests and Analysis (UTA) to guide us during these studies. As follows, some details are provided for more information about these guides.

In this repository, we present our data and results of the [UTA8](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI/meta/wiki/User-Research#user-test-evaluations-) ([10.13140/RG.2.2.22948.40322](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.22948.40322)) guide. These *results* are representing the pieces of information of both [BreastScreening](https://BreastScreening.github.io), [MIDA](https://mida-project.github.io), and [MIMBCD-UI](https://mimbcd-ui.github.io/) projects. These projects are research projects that deal with the use of a recently proposed technique in literature: [Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network). From a developed User Interface (UI) and *framework*, these deep networks will incorporate [several datasets](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI/meta/wiki/Datasets) in different modes. You can find the [deployed prototypes](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI/meta-private/blob/master/wiki/Technical.md#deployment-prototypes) on the [`Technical.md`](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI/meta-private/blob/master/wiki/Technical.md#deployment-prototypes) file of the [`meta-private`](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI/meta-private) repository. More information about the study is also available on the [`User-Research.md`](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI/meta-private/blob/master/wiki/User-Research.md#test-11-assertive-and-non-assertive-introduction-) file of this [`meta-private`](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI/meta-private) repository. Unfortunately, you need to be a member of our team to access the restricted information. We also have several demos to see in our [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPz4aTIVHekHXTxHTUOLmXw), please follow us.

A growing number of decision-making support systems are available for lesion detection and segmentation, two fundamental steps to accomplish diagnosis and treatment planning. This paper proposes a model based on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology to study the determinants for the adoption of intelligent agents across the medical imaging workflow. We tested the model via confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation¬†modeling using clinicians‚Äô data from an international evaluation of healthcare practitioners. Results show an increased understanding of the vital role of security, risk, and trust in the usage intention of intelligent agents. These empirical findings provide valuable theoretical contributions to researchers by explaining the reasons behind the adoption and usage of intelligent agents in the medical imaging workflow.}

## Usage

Usage follow the instructions here to setup the current repository and extract the present data. To understand how the hereby repository is used for, read the following steps.

### Installation

At this point, the only way to install this repository is manual. Eventually, this will be accessible through the [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/), as mentioned on the [roadmap](#Roadmap).

Nonetheless, this kind of installation is as simple as cloning this repository. Virtually all Git and GitHub version control tools are capable of doing that. Through the console, we can use the command below, but other ways are also fine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mida-project/sa-uta8-utaut.git
```

### Demonstration

Please, feel free to try out our radiomics version of the anslysis. It is a source called `Radiomics_changed.r` at the `src/` directory. It can be used as follows:

```bash
Rscript src/Radiomics_changed.r
```

Just keep in mind this is just a script for statistical analysis purposes, so it does nothing more than analyzing data from a radiomics study using various packages in the R language. The script loads libraries that enable it to perform operations on the data, such as read and plot data, perform [Principal Component Analysis (PCA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis), and conduct a [Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmatory_factor_analysis) to identify latent variables and their interrelations. Also, we did our best to make the statistical analysis as user-friendly as possible, so, above everything else, have fun! üòÅ

The first part of the code loads data from an Excel file, converts the data into a likert dataset, and plots it. Then it checks the data, calculates and visualizes the correlation matrix, and performs PCA to obtain principal components.

The code then determines the number of factors to extract from the data and performs maximum likelihood factor analysis, which is followed by visualizing the results using the [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) library. The script then loads another dataset and performs a CFA, followed by computing reliability, discriminant validity, and fit measures of the model. Finally, it extracts the standardized loading matrix, calculates mean squared loadings (*i.e.*, [AVEs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average_variance_extracted)), and calculates the power analysis using `miPowerFit` method.

## Roadmap

[![CII Best Practices](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/3819/badge)](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/3819)

Our goal for this repository is to investigate factors affecting the acceptance of artificial intelligence in medical imaging. To achieve this goal, we will use the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology as the basis for our model, and test it using clinical data from an international evaluation of healthcare practitioners.

We strive to follow best practices for code development and documentation, and have implemented the [Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII)](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en/projects/3172) specifications to ensure the security and reliability of our codebase.

In the future, we aim to create a configuration file to automate testing and publishing of our code to [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) or any other package manager, and we plan to leverage [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)s for this purpose. We may also explore additional goals and objectives as we continue to develop this project.
